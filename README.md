🛠️ Hi, I’m Pow (Andrei)

Electronics Engineering Student @ UPB | Passionate about Low-Level Software and Systems Architecture.

I enjoy building things that require high performance and manual memory management. My focus is on writing efficient C++ for resource-constrained environments, whether it’s for a custom physics engine or real-time telemetry.

🛰️ What I’m building:
Custom Physics & Game Engines: Implementing 2D collision detection and entity behaviors from scratch in C++.  
Embedded Firmware: Developing C++ drivers and data processing filters for ESP32.  
Real-time Systems: Architecting telemetry pipelines using Firebase and Node.js for sub-second latency visualization.  

🧰 Tech Stack
Languages: C++, SystemVerilog, JavaScript (Node.js).  
Tools: Git, Linux, Shell.  
Focus: OOP Principles (Inheritance, Polymorphism) and Algorithmic problem-solving.
