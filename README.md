🛠️ Hi, I'm Pow (Andrei)

​Electronics Engineering Student @ UPB | Passionate about Low-Level Software and Systems Architecture.

​I enjoy building things that require high performance and manual memory management. My focus is on writing efficient C++ for resource-constrained environments, whether it's for a custom physics engine or real-time telemetry.

​🛰️ What I'm building:
​Custom Physics & Game Engines: Implementing 2D collision detection and entity behaviors from scratch in C++. I prioritize zero memory leaks and stable 60 FPS render loops.  
​Embedded Firmware: Developing C++ drivers and data processing filters for ESP32.  
​Real-time Systems: Architecting telemetry pipelines using Firebase and Node.js for sub-second latency visualization.  

​🧰 Tech Stack
​Languages: C++, SystemVerilog, JavaScript (Node.js).  
​Tools: Git, Linux, Shell.  
​Focus: OOP Principles (Inheritance, Polymorphism) and Algorithmic problem-solving.
